        <h2>OUR STORY</h2> <p>&nbsp</p> The Food Recovery Network at UC Davis is a student-run club part of a <a href="https://www.foodrecoverynetwork.org" target="_blank">national organization</a>  comprised of 230 other college chapters across 44 states.  Collectively, more than <big><strong>2.7 million</strong></big> pounds of food have been recovered and <big><strong>2.2 million</strong></big> meals have been donated. 
        The Davis chapter was established in <big><strong>2013</strong></big> with the current leadership team taking on the baton in June, 2017. Since then, our initial team of 5 amazing core officers grew into a large, dynamic team of 10 that we cannot be more proud of-- each officer has been an integral part to how far this club has come. In a year and a half, our team went from hauling food in bike trailers to carrying out recoveries with an electric cart and a university van. We now recover from campus markets and a student cafe-- 5 new recovery outlets--in addition to the dining commons we first started with. In summer of 2018, we kicked off a new program in a wonderful partnership with Yolo County Food Bank to begin recovering from the Davis Farmers' Market every Saturday. We now also donate to a 2nd shelter and have partnered with our campus' Basic Needs Center (Aggie Compass) to donate food that will be distributed to students starting Winter Quarter 2019. The beginning of 2019 also marks our first cohort of 6 recovery interns for our newly established internship program to be offered every quarter to students. As a team, we take great joy in being able to go beyond our classes and campus niche to make tangible, positive impacts in our community during our relatively short time in college. We are deeply passionate about fighting food waste and hunger, and we also like to have fun along the way. We are immensely grateful for our volunteers and our support network of campus partners and community partners. Moreover, it is the friendships gained along the way that we truly cherish, because it is what makes our work and the experience of cultivating our club and strengthening our impact all the more special!
